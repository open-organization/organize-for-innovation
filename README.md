## About the book

What principles ground your organization's culture and drive its operations? And are those principles the ones best suited to solving the problems you're facing?

In *Organize for Innovation*, Jim Whitehurst (Senior Advisor and former President, IBM, and former President and CEO, Red Hat) poses these questions as he reflects on the technological, social, and economic forces impacting the ways we work. Arguing that solving contemporary business problems requires new organizational principles, models, and dynamics, Whitehurst explains how leaders everywhere can begin rethinking how they utilize data, approach failure, structure teams, and set goals—in short, how they can become more innovative.

*Organize for Innovation* complements Whitehurst's widely read management book, *The Open Organization* (Harvard Business Review Press), collecting writing on organizational culture, organizational design, and organizational leadership today—all part of an ongoing conversation about the challenges we face in transformative, fast-moving, and uncertain times.
